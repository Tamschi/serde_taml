TODO: Date

This is an overall rework of the library, which means just about all of the API changed.

The `"serde-object-assist"` feature is still available unchanged. (TODO)

- **Breaking**:
  - Changed license to `MIT OR Apache-2.0`.
  - Set minimum Rust version to 1.53
    > which is required by the newer `taml` dependency.
  - Reworked the entire API with additional features.
  - Likely fixed all panics.
